\section{Other remarks}

I made sure that no memory is leaked by implementing a registry
that stores a linked list of blocks of memory to free.\\
More specific information is available in the code.\\
The \ttt{make valgrind} target will validate the absence of
possible leaks on a range of valid and invalid inputs.

One suggested extension was to display the line number in case
of a parsing error, so I just turned on a few options to get
verbose error printing and line numbers.\\

When several variables are declared with the same name, the
duplicate declarations are ignored. When several procedures are
declared with the same name it does not affect the computation
since nothing relies on a procedure's name. It does however impede
readability of the trace.
