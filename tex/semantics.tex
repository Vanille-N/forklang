\section{Semantics}

Some parts of the semantics were left for us to clarify, here is what I have chosen.\\

\textbf{\ttt{break} outside of a loop terminates the process.\\
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
var f;
proc p
    f := 1;
    break;
    f := 2
end

reach f == 1 // reachable
reach f == 2 // unreachable
\end{lstlisting}
