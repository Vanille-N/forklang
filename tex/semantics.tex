\section{Semantics}

Some parts of the semantics were left for us to clarify, here is what I have chosen.\\

\textbf{Breaking without a loop terminates the process}
\begin{lstlisting}
var f;
proc p
    f := 1;
    break; // proc exits here
    f := 2
end

reach f == 1 // reachable
reach f == 2 // unreachable
\end{lstlisting}


\textbf{Division by zero is considered false and blocking}
\begin{lstlisting}
var f, g;
proc p
    f := 1 / 0; proc is blocked here
    f := 2
end

proc q
    if
    :: 1 \% 0 -> g := 1 // guard is false
    :: else -> g := 2 // else branch is chosen
    fi
end

reach f == 2 // unreachable
reach g == 1 // unreachable
reach g == 2 // reachable
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Range}\\
In addition, I had some time left to implement as an extension
a range operator. It is not available for exhaustive exploration,
but the Monte-Carlo method supports it.\\
It is best explained by the following example:
\begin{lstlisting}
var f,g;
proc p
    f := 2 * {0..5} // f can take any even value between 0 and 10
end

proc q
    var x;
    x := 5;
    if
    :: 0 < {-x..x} -> g := 1 // guard satisfied if number picked is 1,2,...,x
    :: {1..-1} -> g := 2 // empty range is never satisfied
    fi
end

reach f == 0 // reachable
reach f == 1 // unreachable
reach f == 10 // reachable
reach f == 11 // unreachable

reach g == 1 // reachable
\end{lstlisting}
