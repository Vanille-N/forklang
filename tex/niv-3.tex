\section{Level 3}

I chose to implement my own hashset and worklist, in part because I had
already started working on them when the hashset example was provided.\\
The hashset uses a congruential linear hash function on variable values and
states of each process.\\

The worklist is a queue, which ensures that during exhaustive execution each
path found that satisfies a condition is the shortest possible path.\\

With \ttt{\ddash trace}, one can see a computation path that leads to each condition
(this also applies to the \ttt{\ddash rand} mode).
