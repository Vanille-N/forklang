\section{Level 1}

Although a later email said to print a program that is semantically
equivalent, I followed the original requirement to print ``a representation of
the structure''.\\

The output is \textit{not} a valid program.\\
This is also in order to make it easier to link the statements to their
corresponding internal representation by means of their unique identifier
which is printed in the AST.\\

\input{sample-ast.dump}

Notice that the use of S-expressions makes the parsing of operators unambiguous,
and that each statement has a \ttt{<n>} number that uniquely identifies it
and that links it to the internal representation.
